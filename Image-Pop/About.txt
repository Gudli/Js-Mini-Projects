Here our goal is to create an effect using js in which images will pop to the screen and disappear after a fraction of second on mouse move on a specific area.
Here we are creating multiple div's on dynamically on mouse move by calling a function with in a perticular interval of time and this is called throttling in js.Also we are
setting time limit to remove that div's created.
